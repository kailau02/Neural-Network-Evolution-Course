# Neural-Network-Evolution-Course
This project is my first successful attempt at machine learning using neural networks. It was inspired by the Youtuber, Jabrils, which has his source code available on github @ https://github.com/Jabrils/Run-Forrest-FULL/blob/master/README.md

The project requires Unity3D to run. All code contains commenting to explain what is happening and in the Unity inspector, there are sliders to change evolution conditions. The script, "RunnerFactory.cs," is where all genetic selection, crossover, and mutation occur.

I hope this project helps anyone who is struggling to understand neural networks, thanks for stopping by!
